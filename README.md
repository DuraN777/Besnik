#### Comentary  
It was exciting to make this project in such a short time frame.  
I would like to say that I am not happy with the way I managed responsive design, and that I would have definitely done it better if the time allowed it.  
The last sections that I have done are "statistic" and "text-image". I managed to finish them in the last moment but they arent pixel perfect and responsive design is bad if there is any.
