## Project for internship application at StuntCoders

To build run "gulp build-project".  
To launch html and watch for changes run "gulp".  
Or to view the web-page, download dist folder and execute index.html.

#### Comentary  
It was exciting to make this project in such a short time frame.  
I would like to say that I am not happy with the way I managed responsive design, and that I would have definitely done it better if the time allowed it.
